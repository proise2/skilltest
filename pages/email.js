<P><b>Sales Inquiry:</b> Do I need Enterprise? 
<P><b>Subject:</b> Sales Lead for barnesandnoble.com
<P><b>Name:</b> Joe Fox
<P><b>Employees:</b> 1000+
<P>How can we help you: New site launching soon using Next.js and we are thinking about using Vercel
to host. I would like more information about the Enterprise option.
 </li>
<li><P>There are a few things to consider when choosing a hosting provider for your next project. Vercel has a lot of great features, but it's important to make sure that the provider has the resources and capabilities to support your project. </P>

<P>Next.js is a great choice for a new site - it's easy to use and provides a lot of flexibility. Vercel is also a great option for hosting Next.js projects, as we have the resources and experience to support them.</P>
